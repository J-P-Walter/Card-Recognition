# Card-Recognition

Final Project for Computer Vision class, cleaned up a bit

Uses template matching in OpenCV to get the value of cards in a picture. Because of this, can only match cards of the same or similar style to the template

Stretch goals of the project would have been using machine learning instead of template matching and getting the program to work using a video instead of still images.
I believe these ideas would have gone well together, as template matching I think was too much processessing for every frame of the video when I attempted to implement
it. 

Majority of the code was done by myself, but I ran into some issues with the template matching so my group members picked up that part.
