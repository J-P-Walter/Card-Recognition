# Card Recognition

Final Project for Computer Vision class that utilizes template matching in OpenCV to get the value of cards in a picture. 

Stretch goals of the project would have been using machine learning instead of template matching, implementating Blackjack game logic, and getting the program to work using a video instead of still images.
I believe these ideas would have gone well together, as template matching appears too much processessing for every frame when the ability to use video was implemented.
